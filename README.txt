# **Student Manager Application**

## _Introduction_
This application is an exercise for the FIS laboratory. You can find the lab assignment on the [lab web page](http://labs.cs.upt.ro/~oose/pmwiki.php/FSE/LAB2019).

The application is meant to help you learn _Git_. At the same time, we aim at giving you a very short introduction to JavaFX.

## _Java FX_
Java FX is a software framework for delivering UI desktop applications. It is the newest alternative to Java Swing.
This demo project used as inspiration the [official Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/form.htm).

## Issue Tracking
For the purpose of demonstrating a complete Agile Workflow, we created a Jira instance that you can find [here](https://loose.atlassian.net/projects/SM/issues). You will need to use the ID's of the User Stories created there in your commit messages.

## _Happy Coding_
Have a nice time implementing the project!
